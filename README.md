Mini Challenge 1- Say Hello Endpoint

I just used what we learned in lecture today to create a new api file with api controllers and created a request for a name and a greeting, it was suspiciously simple but I know that eventaully it will take longer than 5 minutes to fill in the code

Peer Reviewer: Zach D
Peer Review: Code works as intended and can be called properly on Swagger as well as Postman. Great Job!
